# Land acknowledgement

Before beginning the workshop, we'd like to acknowledge the indigenous lands where we are located.    

We acknowledge and respect the lək̓ʷəŋən peoples on whose traditional territory the university stands and the Songhees, Esquimalt and W̱SÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.
